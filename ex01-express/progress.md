# Progress Tracker

This file tracks the progress of fixing the Sequelize model imports in the services.

## Plan

- [x] Fix `userService.js` to use models from the context instead of direct imports. (Already correct)
- [x] Fix `authService.js` to use models from the context. (Already correct)
- [x] Fix `messageService.js` to use models from the context.
- [x] Fix `tarefaService.js` to use models from the context.
- [x] Adjust `genericService.js` to accept the model from the context. (Already correct)

All services have been checked and corrected. The application should now be able to connect to the database and retrieve data correctly.
